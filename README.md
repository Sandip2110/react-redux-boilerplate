## React-16 Redux Typescript Boilerplate
This is a react, redux and typescript boilerplate. We are using the latest-stable react 16 version, redux, typescript and react-router-dom as router. 
React, react-router-dom, typescript, redux store, reducers everything has been setted up. We are using our custom middleware 
to make the async api calls which is very easy to use. 
You can jump into your project just in 2 minutes, all you have to do is, follow the below steps. 

### To run the project: 
1. clone it
2. run `npm install`
3. `npm start` (In package.josn you can change the REACT_APP_API_ENV varibale to LOCAL || UAT || PROD to run as the corresponding environment)
